### - hello my friend! I am starting to make html/css projects from easy level to hard ones. My Goal is to make really simple and basic project for begginers and help them understand basics.

###### Project level - EASY ######

### - In this project I used a simple html and css (only!).
### - Of course, feel free to make changes and replacing project with your own styles
